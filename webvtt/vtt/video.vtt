<v.first.loud Walter>Run run run as fast as you can

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.000
You can't catch me

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.800 line:1
I'm the gingerbread man

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.000 align:start
<b>You are a monster</b>

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.500 align:end
I'm not the monster here. <i>You are</i>.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.000 align:end
You and the rest of that fairy tale trash

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.000 align:end
poisoning my perfect world

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.500
Now, tell me! Where are the others?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.000
<b>Eat me! [spits milk]</b>

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.700
Now my patience has reached its end!

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
Tell me or I'll...

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.300 align:end line:-4
<b>No, no, not the buttons</b>

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.000 align:end line:-3
<b>Not my gumdrop buttons</b>

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.000 position:20%
All right then. Who's hiding them?
